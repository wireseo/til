# template: 
# 1. Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right. Set up the boundary to include all possible elements.
# 2. Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1? 
    #  Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition function.
# 3. Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.
